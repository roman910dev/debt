# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
    # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
    # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
    # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
    # and their documentation is published at
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
    #
    # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
    # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
    # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
    # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
    # producing the lint.
