# Debt Tracker

A Flutter application I built to start to experiment with Flutter. It is completely functional and works on all Flutter platforms and is actually published in [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.roman910.debt).

It should not be taken as a good example of Dart or Flutter programming as it one of my first projects and I have never rewriten it.

## About the app

A simple light-weight app to help you track how much money you owe people and how much they owe you, following the material design guidelines.

Keep track of the debts for each people and add different annotations with descriptions and dates to remember how much money is being owed and why.
