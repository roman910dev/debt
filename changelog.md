I've fixed some minor bugs about balance calculation and display.

## [1.5.0] - 2023-10-07

I've redesigned some parts of the app to make it a little bit more modern and consistent. Functionality stays exactly the same.

For the courious: I've done this because I've refactored the whole app's code and updated all its dependencies, some of them were outdated. You won't notice this as a user but it should make it more stable and easier to mantain and improve.
